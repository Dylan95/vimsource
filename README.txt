These scripts are designed to split up my vim configuration.  That way I can use parts of it
for vim plugins for other programs.  And I think it's better organized this way.

In addition, if someone else wants to use just some of my scripts, they can pick and choose which files to source.

Be sure to source "functions.vim" before anything else.

The only scripts that depend on other plugins are in the "plugins" folder.

"git.vim" is usefull to me.  But I'm not sure about how usefull it can be to others.

"prettyTabs.vim" is kind of superficial.  It just makes the cursor jump over the full width of the tab in normal mode.  Like a normal text editor.
